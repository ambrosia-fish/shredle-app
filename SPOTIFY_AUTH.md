## Streamlined Spotify Authentication for Guitar Solo Guesser

This document outlines the streamlined approach for implementing Spotify authentication in our Guitar Solo Guesser app.

### Overview

We've implemented a reliable Spotify authentication flow using the standard OAuth approach with client secrets. This approach provides:

1. More robust authentication compared to the PKCE approach
2. Better error handling and recovery
3. Improved user experience with better error messages and diagnostics
4. Premium subscription verification

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Application**:
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
   - Create a new application
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Add your redirect URI: `https://your-domain.com/callback` (or ngrok URL for local testing)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
   ```
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/callback
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5130
   ```

3. **Local Development Setup**:
   - For local development, use ngrok to create a public URL for your frontend:
     ```
     ngrok http 5173
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with the ngrok URL
   - Update the Spotify Dashboard with the same redirect URL

### Implementation Details

The authentication flow follows these steps:

1. **User clicks "Login with Spotify"**:
   - Redirects to Spotify's authorization page
   - Requests necessary scopes (streaming, user info, playback control)

2. **Spotify redirects back to our callback URL**:
   - Our app exchanges the auth code for access/refresh tokens using client credentials
   - We verify the user has a Premium subscription
   - We store tokens securely and manage refreshing them

3. **After authentication**:
   - Non-premium users see a message requiring premium
   - Premium users are redirected to the game

### Testing and Troubleshooting

To ensure authentication works properly:

1. **Clear your browser storage** if you experience issues
2. **Check the debug panel** in development mode
3. **Verify your redirect URI** matches exactly between your app and Spotify Dashboard
4. **Ensure you're using a Premium account** for SDK functionality

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid client secret errors**: Double-check the secret in your `.env` file
2. **Redirect errors**: Ensure the URI is identical to what's in Spotify Dashboard
3. **SDK errors**: Verify your Premium subscription status

### Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. To further improve:

1. Consider implementing token encryption for added security
2. Add silent token refresh to avoid interrupting gameplay
3. Improve premium upsell messaging for non-premium users

For any issues, check the debug panel and the browser console for detailed logs.
